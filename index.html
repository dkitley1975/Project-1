               <h1>A Brief History of Yoga</h1>
               <p>Yoga has a vast and rich, 5,000-year history. This is because it is such a multifaceted practice, Yoga has in the past intertwined with philosophy, religion and exercise.
                  There are suggestions that the principles of yoga stem from a Bronze age civilization in the northwestern regions of South Asia, the Indus Valley civilization. Whilst others have noted references to Yoga between 500 BCE and 200 BCE. This time scale is when the philological ideas of Hinduism and Buddhism were taking shape.<br>
                  During the Vedic Period era the four ancient scriptures (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda) were created, these are the holy writings of Brahmanism. It is in these scriptures that the Sanskrit word "Yuj" (the root of the word Yoga) is first mentioned.<br>
                  During the pre-classical period era the 700-verse Bhagavad Gita was created, this is the most famous of Hindu texts and is credited as being the oldest known yoga scripture. Although these teachings are dedicated entirely to Yoga as it existed at the time, very little is devoted to the practical elements of the practice.
               </p>

            <div class="history-classical">
               <h2>Classical</h2>
               <p>2,000 years ago an Indian sage and author of several Sanskrit texts, Patanjali structured the practice of yoga and through documenting his work, the Yoga Sutras, were able to follow his work.
                  Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are credited with being the foundation of classic yoga as we know it. 
                  Pantanjali set out as a means for living a life of purpose and meaning the following:
               <ul>
                  <li>Asana – relates to the practice of physical postures, these are the most well known of the eight limbs</li>
                  <li>Dharana – an aid to concentration, a way of drawing the senses inward</li>
                  <li>Dhyana – the practice of meditation</li>
                  <li>Niyama – is the correct conduct towards oneself, and a means of aiding personal growth</li>
                  <li>Pranayama – a method of controlling the breath</li>
                  <li>Pratyahara – a way of controlling the senses</li>
                  <li>Samadhi – the combination of mediation and the subject of meditation, this is often related to obtaining enlightenment</li>
                  <li>Yama – these are the ethical rules relating to the conduct towards others or social discipline</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Post-Classical</h2>
               <p>The West was introduced to Yoga in the early 19th century and its Eastern teachings and philosophies. The early Yoga philosophies and teachings have become westernised over time.
                  Through this period many gurus and teachers of Yoga travelled West to promote and teach the ways of Yoga.
                  Swami Sivananda was one such guru, he was responsible for writing over 200 books on yoga and its philosophies.
                  <br>
                  Two other well-known names from this period include: Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who is referred to as the father of modern Yoya, was one of the most influential yoga teachers of the 20th century, and the 'giggling guru' 'known for regularly laughing during TV interviews' Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who developed Transcendental Meditation. A technique exercised by over 5 million people worldwide.

               <h2>Modern Yoga</h2>
               <p>This is the form of Yoga practised in studios, gyms and homes worldwide today. This form of Yoga has just as complex lineage as the forms preceding it. 
                  Multiple current styles of modern Yoga are based on Hatha Yoga.
                  There are  several  prominent styles of Yoga you may have heard of or be familiar with, they include:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Ashtanga</li>
                  <li>Bikram - more commonly known as hot yoga</li>
                  <li>Hatha</li>
                  <li>Integral</li>
                  <li>Iyengar</li>
                  <li>Kundalini</li>
                  <li>Sivananda</li>
                  <li>Viniyoga</li>
                  <li>Vinyasa</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Yoga has developed and evolved as a practice and form of exercise over the last 5000 years and maybe considered an organic form. It is likely to continue to develop, grow and evolve for thousands of years to come.
