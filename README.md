### **Design Choices**
As the site is to inform the user about yoga, the design choices were made around calmness and tranquility. The site is not to be afraid of blank space.

I have used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that fits the overall feeling calmness.

<a></a>
#### Typeface
In order to find appropriate typefaces for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the main body text I have chosen the google typeface Source Sans Pro. This is a visually appealing and easy to read typeface.
For the headings I wanted a slightly different typeface. I explored for headings on [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/ "Font Pair") and choose the google font Lato.
This font is visually appealing and pairs well with source sans pro.


<a></a>
#### Colors
I based my color scheme on a pallet devised around beach landscapes using the crams of the sand to help create a calm, natural feeling. 

![Color Scheme](wireframes/color-scheme.png)

* rgba(254, 232, 223, 1) This color is called Champagne Pink - will be used as  a background colour and will be used with a .6 transparency. 
* rgba(222, 183, 152, 1) This color is called tumbleweed - to be used as a contrast tot the background colour.
* rgba(153, 95, 58, 1) This color is a called Brown Sugar - This is to be used as my header colours.
* rgba(153, 95, 58, 1) This color is a called Van Dyke Brown - This is to be used as my colour to over lay the Champagne Pink.
* The main colour of my text is to be black.


I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable.

## **Wireframes**
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
Initially I created a basic wireframe for the mobile and then for tablet with the desktop last. 
For my website I have decided to go for a 1 page scrolling website which suits more with todays current trends, with a fixed navigation bar at the top for easy navigation. 
I based the wireframe on the smaller iphone 5s screen and will apply media queries where required to keep the responsiveness site.

You can find my wireframes below:
