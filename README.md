### Typeface
In order to find appropriate typefaces for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the main body text I have chosen the google typeface Source Sans Pro. This is a visually appealing and easy to read typeface.
For the headings I wanted a slightly different typeface. I explored for headings on [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/ "Font Pair") and choose the google font Lato.
This font is visually appealing and pairs well with source sans pro.

![Typefaces](../yoga-centric/readme-assets/../../Yoga-Centric/readme-assets/stylings/typefaces.png)

### Colours
I based my color scheme on a pallet devised around beach landscapes using the crams of the sand to help create a calm, natural feeling.

* rgba(254, 232, 223, 1) This color is called Champagne Pink - will be used as  a background colour and will be used with a .6 transparency. 
* rgba(222, 183, 152, 1) This color is called tumbleweed - to be used as a contrast tot the background colour.
* rgba(153, 95, 58, 1) This color is a called Brown Sugar - This is to be used as my header colours.
* rgba(153, 95, 58, 1) This color is a called Van Dyke Brown - This is to be used as my colour to over lay the Champagne Pink.
* The main colour of my text is to be black.

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Credits 

### Content 

- The Newsletter sign up section uses Email.js to implement the sending of the emails - Instead of having the javascript run totally within the html, I created a new .js file and placed the code in there. referencing this external file. I added additional code to this to add a 'display = "none"' to the original Newsletter Sign-up form and display = "block" to the Thank you form.
- I wanted to incorporate on the mobile Navigation menu the ability to have it automatically close after selecting a link. I google and found the solution I required here: https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-4gci. Adapting and incorporating this into my navigation worked.
- I wanted to highlight the active sections on the desktop navigation and used javascript coding from:  https://codepen.io/malsu/pen/VwKzoPG to achieve this.
- The instructions for the Yoga poses was taken from:
https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercises/definitive-guide-to-yoga#-the-basics-and-foundation
Rather than attempt to rewrite these instructions It was better to use the verbatim, as trying to rewrite them would still cause an issue with plagiarism checkers and most likely would cause some one a injury from following unsafe instructions.
